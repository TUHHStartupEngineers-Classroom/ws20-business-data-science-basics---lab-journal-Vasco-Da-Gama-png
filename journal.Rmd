# Intro to the tidyverse - Challenge

In the following is the code and the figures shown I've been writing for the first challenge.

## First excercise

**Task:**
Analyze the sales by location (state) with a bar plot. Since state and city are multiple features (variables), they should be split. Which state has the highest revenue? Replace your bike_orderlines_wrangled_tbl object with the newly wrangled object (with the columns state and city).

Attached is the code and the figure for the first exercise of the challenge. As you can see North Rhine-Westphalia is the state with the highest revenue.

# Data Science at TUHH ------------------------------------------------------
# SALES ANALYSIS ----

# 1.0 Load libraries ----

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)

# 2.0 Importing Files ----

bikes_tbl <- read_excel(path = "data-science/00_data/01_bike_sales/01_raw_data/bikes.xlsx")
orderline_tbl <- read_excel(path = "data-science/00_data/01_bike_sales/01_raw_data/orderlines.xlsx")

# Not necessary for this analysis, but for the sake of completeness
bikeshops_tbl  <- read_excel("data-science/00_data/01_bike_sales/01_raw_data/bikeshops.xlsx")

# 4.0 Joining Data ----

bike_orderlines_joined_tbl <- orderline_tbl %>%
  left_join(bikes_tbl, by = c("product.id" = "bike.id")) %>%
  left_join(bikeshops_tbl, by = c("customer.id" = "bikeshop.id"))

# 5.0 Wrangling Data ----

bike_orderlines_wrangled_tbl <- bike_orderlines_joined_tbl %>%
  # 5.1 Separate category name
  separate(col = category,
           into = c("category.1", "category.2", "category.3"),
           sep = " - ") %>%
  
  # Separate citty and state
  separate(col = location,
           into = c("city", "state"),
           sep = ", ") %>%
  
  # 5.2 Add the total price (price * quantity) 
  # Add a column to a tibble that uses a formula-style calculation of other columns
  mutate(total.price = price * quantity) %>%
  
  # 5.3 Optional: Reorganize. Using select to grab or remove unnecessary columns
  # 5.3.1 by exact column name
  select(-...1, -gender) %>%
  
  # 5.3.2 by a pattern
  # You can use the select_helpers to define patterns. 
  # Type ?ends_with and click on Select helpers in the documentation
  select(-ends_with(".id")) %>%
  
  # 5.3.3 Actually we need the column "order.id". Let's bind it back to the data
  bind_cols(bike_orderlines_joined_tbl %>% select(order.id)) %>% 
  
  # 5.3.4 You can reorder the data by selecting the columns in your desired order.
  # You can use select_helpers like contains() or everything()
  select(order.id, contains("order"), contains("model"), contains("category"),
         price, quantity, total.price,
         everything()) %>%
  
  # 5.4 Rename columns because we actually wanted underscores instead of the dots
  # (one at the time vs. multiple at once)
  rename(bikeshop = name) %>%
  set_names(names(.) %>% str_replace_all("\\.", "_"))
  

# 6.0 Business Insights ----
# 6.1 Sales by location ----
# Step 1 - Manipulate
sales_by_loc_tbl <- bike_orderlines_wrangled_tbl %>%
  
  # Select columns
  select(state, total_price) %>%
  
  # Grouping and summarizing
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(sales = sum(total_price)) %>%
  
  # arranging it with descending price
  arrange(desc(sales)) %>%
  
   # Optional: Add a column that turns the numbers into a currency format 
  # (makes it in the plot optically more appealing)
  # mutate(sales_text = scales::dollar(sales)) <- Works for dollar values
  mutate(sales_text = scales::dollar(sales, big.mark = ".", 
                                     decimal.mark = ",", 
                                     prefix = "", 
                                     suffix = " €"))

# Step 2 - Visualize
sales_by_loc_tbl %>%
  
  # Setup canvas with the columns state (x-axis) and sales (y-axis)
  ggplot(aes(x = state, y = sales)) +
  
  # Geometries
  geom_col(fill = "#2DC6D6") + # Use geom_col for a bar plot
  geom_label(aes(label = sales_text)) + # Adding labels to the bars
  #geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + # Adding a trendline
  
  # Formatting
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + # Change the y-axis.
  # Again, we have to adjust it for euro values
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(big.mark = ".",
                                                    decimal.mark = ",",
                                                    prefix = "",
                                                    suffix = " €")) +
  # rotating x-axis labels
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  
  labs(
    title    = "Revenue by year in the states",
    #subtitle = "Upward Trend",
    x = "", # Override defaults for x and y
    y = "Revenue"
  )
```

## Second exercise

**Task:**
Analyze the sales by location and year (facet_wrap). Because there are 12 states with bike stores, you should get 12 plots.

In the next part, the manipulation and the figure for the years and the location is made. As you can see in all states, except Mecklenburg-Western Pommern, Saxony-Anhalt and Schleswig-Holstein, revenue trend is going upwards.

```{r challenge1_2, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
# 6.2 Sales by Year and location ----
# Step 1 - Manipulate
sales_by_loc_year_tbl <- bike_orderlines_wrangled_tbl %>%
  
  # Select columns and add a year
  select(order_date, total_price, state) %>%
  mutate(year = year(order_date)) %>%
  
  # Group by and summarize year and main catgegory
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarise(sales = sum(total_price)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  
  # Format $ Text
  mutate(sales_text = scales::dollar(sales, big.mark = ".", 
                                     decimal.mark = ",", 
                                     prefix = "", 
                                     suffix = " €"))

# Step 2 - Visualize
sales_by_loc_year_tbl %>%
  
  # Set up x, y, fill
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = sales, fill = state)) +
  
  # Geometries
  geom_col() + # Run up to here to get a stacked bar plot
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + # Adding a trendline
  
  # Facet
  facet_wrap(~ state) +
  
  # Formatting
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(big.mark = ".", 
                                                    decimal.mark = ",", 
                                                    prefix = "", 
                                                    suffix = " €")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  
  labs(
    title = "Revenue by year and state",
    subtitle = "",
    fill = "State" # Changes the legend name
  )
```

# Data Acquisition - Challenge

## First Challenge

**Task:**
Get some data via an API. There are millions of providers, that offer API access for free and have good documentation about how to query their service. You just have to google them. You can use whatever service you want. For example, you can get data about your listening history (spotify), get data about flights (skyscanner) or just check the weather forecast.

The first challenge was to get some Data via an API. I decided myself for the free Covid19 API. With that I collected information for the last updated data all around the world and for Germany. For the data of Germany I even plotted the summed up amount of confirmed infected people. 

```{r challenge2_1, fig.width=15, fig.height=10}
library(tidyverse) # Main Package - Loads dplyr, purrr, etc.
library(rvest)     # HTML Hacking & Web Scraping
library(xopen)     # Quickly opening URLs
library(jsonlite)  # converts JSON files to R objects
library(glue)      # concatenate strings
library(stringi)   # character string/text processing
library(furrr)     # Parallel Processing using purrr (iteration)
library(lubridate)
library(RSQLite)
library(httr)
library(purrr)

link1 <- "https://api.covid19api.com/summary"
resp <- link1 %>%
  GET()

covid_global <- resp %>% 
  .$content %>% 
  rawToChar() %>% 
  fromJSON() %>%
  purrr::pluck("Countries") %>%
  as_tibble()

cases_by_country_tbl <- covid_global %>%
  transmute(Country, CountryCode, NewConfirmed,TotalConfirmed, NewDeaths, TotalDeaths, NewRecovered, TotalRecovered, Date = date(Date)) %>%
  arrange(desc(TotalConfirmed))

link2 <- "https://api.covid19api.com/dayone/country/germany/status/confirmed"
resp <- link2 %>%
  GET()

covid_germany_conf_tbl <- resp %>% 
  .$content %>% 
  rawToChar() %>%
  fromJSON() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  transmute(Date = date(Date), Cases)

cases_by_country_tbl
covid_germany_conf_tbl

plot(covid_germany_conf_tbl$Date,covid_germany_conf_tbl$Cases,
     main="Development of Corona in Germany",
     xlab = "Time",
     ylab="Sum of Confirmed Infected",
     type="l",
     col="blue")
```

## Second Challenge

**Task:**
Scrape one of the competitor websites of canyon (either https://www.rosebikes.de/ or https://www.radon-bikes.de) and create a small database. The database should contain the model names and prices for at least one category. Use the selectorgadget to get a good understanding of the website structure.

The second exercise was to scrape data from a website. I decided for the website of ROSE bikes an collected the data for the mountainbike family. Therefore I wanted to get in the end a tibble which lists the model names and prices. The code is shown below. 

```{r challenge2_2, fig.width=15, fig.height=10}
# second exercise ----
url_home <- "https://www.rosebikes.de/"
url_mtb <- "https://www.rosebikes.de/fahrr%C3%A4der/mtb"

# Read in the HTML for the entire webpage
html_mtb <- read_html(url_mtb)

mtb_category_urls <- html_mtb %>%
  html_nodes(css = ".catalog-category-bikes__button") %>%
  html_attr("href") %>%
  # Convert vector to tibble
  enframe(name = "position", value = "subdirectory") %>%
  
  # Add the domain, because we will get only the subdirectories
  mutate(url = glue("https://www.rosebikes.de{subdirectory}")) %>%
  
  # Some categories are listed multiple times.
  # We only need unique values
  distinct(url)


getBikeData <- function(model_category_url) {
  # Read in the html
  html_model_category <- read_html(model_category_url)
  
  # Get the model names
  model_names <- html_model_category %>%
    html_nodes(css = ".catalog-category-model__title") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    # Remove the query parameters of the URL
    str_replace_all(pattern = "\\n","") %>%
    # Convert vector to tibble
    enframe(name ="position", value ="model")
  
  #Get the model prices
  model_prices <- html_model_category %>%
    html_nodes(css = ".catalog-category-model__price-current-value") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    # Remove the query parameters of the URL
    str_replace_all(pattern = "\\n","") %>%
    str_replace_all(pattern = "€","") %>%
    str_replace_all(pattern = ",00","") %>%
    str_replace_all(pattern = "\\.","") %>%
    str_replace_all(pattern = "\\s","") %>%
    # Convert to numeric
    as.numeric() %>%
    # Convert vector to tibble
    enframe(name ="position", value = "price")
  
  bikeData <- left_join(model_names, model_prices, by= "position") %>%
    select(model, price)
}  

# Extract the urls as a character vector
mtb_category_urls_vec <- mtb_category_urls %>% 
  pull(url)

# Run the function with every url as an argument
bike_data_lst <- map(mtb_category_urls_vec, getBikeData)

# Merge the list into a tibble
bike_data_tbl <- bind_rows(bike_data_lst)

bike_data_tbl
```

<!-- # Adding R stuff -->

<!-- So far this is just a blog where you can write in plain text and serve your writing to a webpage. One of the main purposes of this lab journal is to record your progress learning R. The reason I am asking you to use this process is because you can both make a website, and a lab journal, and learn R all in R-studio. This makes everything really convenient and in the same place.  -->

<!-- So, let's say you are learning how to make a histogram in R. For example, maybe you want to sample 100 numbers from a normal distribution with mean = 0, and standard deviation = 1, and then you want to plot a histogram. You can do this right here by using an r code block, like this: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- samples <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1) -->
<!-- hist(samples) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- When you knit this R Markdown document, you will see that the histogram is printed to the page, along with the R code. This document can be set up to hide the R code in the webpage, just delete the comment (hashtag) from the cold folding option in the yaml header up top. For purposes of letting yourself see the code, and me see the code, best to keep it the way that it is. You'll learn that all of these things and more can be customized in each R code block. -->
